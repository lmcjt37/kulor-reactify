# Kulor-reactify

## Description
This is a colour conversion app that allows you to convert colours between RGB, HEX and HSL colour modes. The background of the app updates to provide you with a representation of what the colour you are converting looks like. It is written using vanilla React without any flux/redux framework to keep it simple.

Includes:
* Randomisation
* Lighten
* Darken
* More to come...

2. Run `npm install && npm run dev`, this will install all dependencies, build and start up the server
